        <p><p><span>A University of Regina graduate has been honoured for contributions to the engineering and geoscience professions.</span></p>
<p><span>Shawna Argue BASc&#8217;87 was the recipient of the Lieutenant Governor&#8217;s Meritorious Achievement Award at a ceremony in Saskatoon on November 26. Argue is not only the first U of R grad to receive this prestigious honour, she is also the first woman to receive the award in its 17-year history. </span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;What a tremendous honour to be recognized in this way and to be among such an elite group of previous Meritorious Achievement Award recipients,&#8221; said Argue. &#8220;It&#8217;s very humbling to be selected by my peers for such an award.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Currently the Director of Registration for the Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of Saskatchewan (APEGS), Argue has enjoyed a dynamic career that has seen her become one of the most respected members of the province&#8217;s engineering community. </span></p>
<p><span>From 2004-2015, Argue owned her own consulting business &#8211; Argue and Associates Management Consultants, Inc. &#8211; working with a variety of Western Canadian clients in industries including resource extraction, oil and gas production and transportation, utilities and manufacturing. Previous accolades for Argue have included being named as a Woman of Distinction by the Regina YWCA and as a recipient of the Regina Engineering Society&#8217;s Engineering Excellence and Volunteer Awards. </span></p>
<p><span>In addition to her professional accomplishments, Argue has been a tireless volunteer in the community, fundraising more than $40,000 for CIBC Run for the Cure and serving many organizations including the Royal Regina Golf Club, the Assiniboia Club, the Regina Business and Professional Women&#8217;s Club, the Canadian Red Cross Water Safety Service, and the Royal Lifesaving Society. Prior to joining APEGS as a staff member, she was a long-time volunteer, including serving on Council and as President.&#160; She has also been the Saskatchewan Director and a Past President of the Canadian Society of Senior Engineers and is an Alternate Warden for Camp 25 for the Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer Iron Ring Ceremony.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Shawna is highly respected in her field and throughout the entire engineering profession,&#8221; said David deMontigny, Associate Dean (Academic) of the Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science. &#8220;She is a strong role model for everyone on what can be achieved when you work hard with integrity and passion.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Attending the University of Regina from 1982-1987, Argue graduated with a degree in Industrial Systems Engineering with a co-op education designation. She was in one of the first graduating classes of the then-new systems approach &#8211; combining theoretical knowledge with social, economic, and environmental aspects of the profession.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;There were only 30 or so of us that graduated in 1987 and I was one of only three women and the only woman in Industrial Systems engineering,&#8221; said Argue. &#8220;Because we were a small group we got to know our faculty members really well and worked very collaboratively on all of our projects.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Argue would build upon her degree to become not only a highly respected engineer but a highly regarded and well-rounded professional.&#160; </span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;My time at the U of R taught me how to solve problems with a logical and scientific approach. Because of the systems approach, we took classes in other disciplines, including business and economics, which helped me in the non-engineering roles of a consulting company,&#8221; said Argue. &#8220;When I went to get my MBA, some of my course credits even transferred!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Acknowledging the tremendous career Argue has built, deMontigny noted how much this award means to his Faculty. </span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;All of us in the Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science are delighted to hear of this award and wish Shawna continued success in her career,&#8221; said deMontigny.</span></p></p>
